### Section 1 - Velocity and Distance
#### Definitions
  I. Differential Calculus
    Calculus centralized on differentiation
    E.g. finding velocity from a record of distance

  II. Integral Calculus
    Calculus centralized on integration
    E.g. finding distance from a history of velocity

  III. Functions
    The number v(t) is a value of the function v at time t
    Time t is the input of the function, velocity v(t) is the output
    A function is a rule that assigns one member of a range to each member of a
      domain

  IV. Domain and Range
    The domain of a function is the set of inputs
    The range is the set of outputs

#### Key Points
  I. Relationship between Velocity and Distance
    Velocity is the slope of the distance graph:
      slope = ∆ distance / ∆ time = vt / t = v
    The area under the velocity graph gives the distance

  II. Constant Velocity
    f = vt

  III. Constant Acceleration
    f = 1/2 at^2


### Section 2 - Calculus without Limits
#### Definitions
  I. Piecewise Linear and Piecewise Constant
    These are two properties that define the shape of a graph:
      Piecewise Linear entails that every "piece" of a graph is linear
      Piecewise Constance entails that every "piece" of a graph is constant
      The derivative of a piecewise linear graph will be piecewise constant

#### Key Points
  I. Properties of Slopes
    The differences (slope) of f's in a graph add up to f_last - f_first
    The total area under the v-graph is f_last - f_first

  II. Properties of Odd Numbers
    The first j odd numbers always add up to j^2


### Section 3 - The Velocity at an Instant
#### Definitions
  I. Secant Line
    A line that touches two points on a curve

#### Key Points
  I. Average Velocity
    Average velocity of a curve is the slope of the straight line between the
      start and end points

  II. Velocity at an Instant
    The velocity at an instant requires us to find the slope between points
      that are closer and closer on the curve. The limit of this calculation
      is the slope at the instant.

### Section 4 - Circular Motion
#### Definitions
  I. Degrees and Radians
    A full circle is 360 degrees and 2π radians, therefore:
      1 radian = 360/2π degrees ≈ 57.3 degrees
      1 degree = 2π/360 radians ≈ 0.0175 radians

#### Key Points
  I. Basic Concepts of Trigonometry
    A right triangle contains sides of length:
      cos(t), sin(t) and 1, where t is the size of the angle adjacent to cos(t)
    Pythagoras's law:
      (cos(t))^2 + (sin(t))^2 = 1

  II. Relation of Sine and Cosine curves
    When the distance is f(t) = sin(t), the velocity is v(t) = cos(t)
    When the distance is f(t) = cos(t), the velocity is v(t) = -sin(t)

  III. Harmonic Motion
    v = cos(t)
    f = sin(t)

  VI. Modern Mathematics
    Modern mathematics is a combination of exact formulas and approximate
    computations

### Section 5 - A Review of Trigonometry
#### Definitions
  I. Basic Functions of Trigonometry for Triangles
    cos Θ = a/c = near_side/hypotenuse
    sin Θ = b/c = far_side/hypotenuse
    tan Θ = b/a = far_side/near_side
    sec Θ = c/a = 1/cos Θ
    csc Θ = c/b = 1/sin Θ
    cot Θ = a/b = 1/tan Θ

    tan Θ = sin Θ/cos Θ

  II. Basic Functions of Trigonometry for Circles
    cos -Θ = cos Θ
    sin -Θ = -sin Θ
    tan -Θ = -tan Θ

  ΙΙΙ. Κey Identities of Trigonometry
    (cos(t))^2 + (sin(t))^2 = 1
    1 + (tan(t))^2 = (sec(t))^2
    (cot(t))^2 + 1 = (csc(t))^2

  IV. Distance Between Points
    d = √(x2 - x1)^2 + (y2 - y1)^2

  VI. Addition Formula
    cos(s-t) = cos(s)cos(t) + sin(s)sin(t)
    cos(s+t) = cos(s)cos(t) - sin(s)sin(t)

  VII. Double Angle Formula
    cos2t = cos^2(t) - sin^2(t) = 2cos^2(t) - 1 = 1 - 2sin^2(t)

#### Key Points
  I. Trigonometry and Circles
    Triangles are limited because they can only represent angles up to 180°
    For circles we measure angles counter clockwise from the positive x axis:
      90° is straight up, 180° is left...
    We use radians instead of degrees for simplicity of calculations
