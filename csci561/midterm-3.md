### 1. Quantifying Uncertainty

#### Sources
- Lecture 17 - Week 10
- AIMA - Chapter 13

#### Definitions

##### I. Sources of Uncertainty

###### a. Theoretical Ignorance
    Some problem domains do not have a complete theory. For example, we do not
    have a model that predicts car accidents, nor do we have a complete model
    for medical science

###### b. Practical Ignorance
    Even if we have a complete theory for a problem domain, it is possible that
    we have not or cannot test every detail in our problem. For example, we
    don't always know who or what is on the road right now.

###### c. Laziness
    It is too much work to list the complete set of antecedents or consequents
    needed to ensure an exceptionless rule and too hard to use such rules.
